## Open Web Apps Helper

This is a (currently) small library to do helpful things for your
[Mozilla Web Apps](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/apps/partners/) app.

Right now it does validation of receipts, specifically targetted at
HTML-only applications (i.e., applications where the server doesn't do
anything but serve static files).
